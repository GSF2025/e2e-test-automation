#Playwright E2E Testing Guide

We are going to start writing automated end-to-end (E2E) tests in our staging site.

##What is Playwright?

Playwright is an open-source framework by Microsoft for end-to-end testing of web applications. You can simulate user interactions such as navigating between pages, filling out forms, etc.

1. Cross-Browser Testing: Playwright enables you to test your app across Chromium (Google Chrome), Firefox, and WebKit (Safari)

2. Powerful features: it includes tools for debugging, taking screenshots, recording videos, and even simulating different devices or network conditions
